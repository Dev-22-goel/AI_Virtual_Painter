# AI Virtual Painter Python
Created a Virtual Painter Tool which can draw on the system's screen or also on a plain page using OpenCV, Numpy and Mediapipe. It does by recognizing finger patterns using a Hand detecting module, which I learnt to improvise and added new features to it.

**Hand Detection** is a python software which is designed to detect hand movements and patterns. This can help to increase or decrease volume and brightness.
